# Testing Your Stripe Integration

## Current Status ‚úÖ

Your Stripe integration has been updated from mock/demo to real Stripe API calls. Here's what was fixed:

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:
1. **Replaced Mock StripeService** - Now makes real API calls to Stripe
2. **Updated Payment Flow** - Removed auto-credit logic, requires real payment confirmation
3. **Fixed Controllers** - Both billing and subscription controllers now use real Stripe
4. **Added Frontend Integration** - Stripe Elements for payment confirmation
5. **Created Setup Script** - Easy configuration with test keys

### üîß Files Updated:
- `app/services/stripe_service.rb` - Real Stripe API integration
- `app/controllers/billing_controller.rb` - Fixed currency handling
- `app/controllers/subscriptions_controller.rb` - Updated with real price IDs
- `app/views/billing/show.html.erb` - Payment confirmation page
- `app/views/subscriptions/show.html.erb` - Fixed Stripe key reference
- `app/javascript/controllers/stripe_controller.js` - Frontend payment handling
- `.env` - Environment variables for API keys
- `Gemfile` - Added dotenv-rails gem

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 minutes):

1. **Get Stripe Test Keys:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
   - Copy your test keys
   - Replace placeholders in `.env` file

2. **Create Test Products:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products
   - Create "Monthly Pro" ($29/month)
   - Create "Annual Pro" ($290/year)
   - Copy the Price IDs (start with `price_`)

3. **Update Price IDs:**
   - Edit `app/controllers/subscriptions_controller.rb`
   - Replace `price_1QExampleMonthly` and `price_1QExampleAnnual` with your real Price IDs

4. **Test the Integration:**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   rails server
   ```
   - Visit http://localhost:3000/billing
   - Click "Purchase" on any credit package
   - Use test card: 4242424242424242

## üß™ Test Cards:
- **Success**: 4242424242424242
- **3D Secure**: 4000002500003155  
- **Decline**: 4000000000000002
- **Expired**: 4000000000000069

## üîç What Should Work Now:

4. Shows real payment status
5. Credits added when payment succeeds (via webhook)

### Subscription Flow:
1. Click "Subscribe Now" or "Choose Plan"
2. Creates real Stripe Subscription
3. Redirects to payment confirmation if needed

5. Updates user access when payment succeeds

## üêõ Troubleshooting:

**"No such price" error:**

- Restart Rails server after changing .env

**"Payment failed" error:**

Your buttons should now work with real Stripe payments! üéâ
